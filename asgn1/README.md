# How to use plot.sh

Running plot.sh generates four pdf documents. To generate all four documents type `./plot.sh` in terminal and then click return.  
plot.sh does not accept any arguments or take any options. The Makefile is used to generate a collatz executable from collatz.c  
during the runtime of plot.sh.
