# Instructions on the use of mathlib-test.c  

In order to compile mathlib-test.c type `make all` into your terminal.  

After all of the necesary executables have been compiled type `./mathlib-test` followed the desired options.  

mathlib-test accepts options -s -c -S -C -T -l and -a. The list belows shows what each one does.  
  
`-s`: runs all sin tests.  
`-c`: runs all cos tests.  
`-S`: runs all arcsin tests.  
`-C`: runs all arccos tests.  
`-T`: runs all arctan tests.  
`-l`: runs all log tests.  

However, if mathlib-test is run with the option `-a` , no matter the other options, every test will be run once and only once.
